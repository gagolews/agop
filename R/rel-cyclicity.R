#' Cyclic Binary Relations
#'
#' @description
#' A binary relation \eqn{R} is \emph{cyclic}, iff
#' its transitive closure is not antisymmetric.
#' Note that \eqn{R} may be reflexive and still acyclic,
#' i.e., loops in \eqn{R} are not taken into account.
#'
#' @details
#' \code{rel_is_cyclic} has \eqn{O(n^3)} time complexity,
#' where \eqn{n} is the number of rows in \code{R}
#' (the implemented algorithm currently verifies whether a depth-first search-based
#' topological sorting is possible).
#' Missing values in \code{R} always result in \code{NA}.
#'
#' @param R an object coercible to a 0-1 (logical) square matrix,
#' representing a binary relation on a finite set.
#'
#' @return \code{rel_is_cyclic} returns
#' a single logical value.
