#' D2OWA Operators
#'
#' @description
#' Computes the D2OWA operator, i.e.,
#' the normalized L2 distance between a numeric vector and an OWA operator.
#'
#' @details
#' D2OWA is a symmetric spread measure.
#' It is defined as
#' \code{d2owa(x) == sqrt(mean((x-owa(x,w))^2))}.
#' Not all weights, however, generate a proper function of this kind;
#' \code{d2owa_checkwts} may be used to check that.
#' For \code{d2owa}, if \code{w} is not appropriate, an error is thrown.
#'
#' \code{w} is automatically normalized so that its elements sum up to 1.
#'
#' @param x numeric vector to be aggregated
#' @param w numeric vector of the same length as \code{x}, with elements in \eqn{[0,1]},
#' and such that \eqn{\sum_i w_i=1}{sum(x)=1}; weights
#' @return For \code{d2owa}, a single numeric value is returned.
#' On the other hand, \code{d2owa_checkwts} returns a single logical value.
